Feature: Macro tolerance — forgiving colour logic

  Scenario: Macro within 5g of target — counts as hit
    Given a macro is within 5g of its target in either direction
    Then the macro bar shows the macro's own colour (blue / orange / red-orange)
    And the label does not show red or amber

  Scenario: Macro 5–15g over target — amber
    Given a macro is between 5g and 15g over its target
    Then the macro bar turns amber (#ffb84b)
    And the label turns amber
    And no red is shown

  Scenario: Macro 15g+ over target — red
    Given a macro is more than 15g over its target
    Then the macro bar turns red (#ff5555)
    And the label turns red

  Scenario: Macro under target by any amount — in range
    Given a macro is under its target by more than 5g
    Then the macro bar stays the macro's own colour
    And no warning colour is shown
